# Database Generator

The **Database Generator** is an automated solution designed to create and seed a database for my Database
project at the University of Porto. The commits are in https://github.com/RobertGleison/databases-training-projects/tree/main/shark-tank.<br>
Please note that this is not a universal model, it only works with a specific CSV file. You can find the
dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thirumani/shark-tank-us-dataset).

## Project Overview

In the context of this project, the primary objective is to generate a small UML model using a real dataset. The
subsequent steps involve converting this model into a relational representation and creating and populating a database
based on this dataset.
While exploring datasets on Kaggle, I identified a comprehensive CSV file related to the TV show Shark Tank. Recognizing
the challenges associated with manually populating a database with this data, I decided to develop a Java program to
automate the entire process.

## Technologies Used

In this project, I used the following technologies:

- **Spring:** A comprehensive framework that provides support for various aspects of application development in Java.

- **JPA (Java Persistence API):** A standard Java specification for data access that simplifies the interaction between
  Java applications and relational databases.

- **Hibernate:** An object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that facilitates the mapping of Java objects to database
  tables.

- **PostgreSQL:** The final database file was generated in PostgreSQL, a Relational Database Management System.
